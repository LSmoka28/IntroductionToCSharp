Array Review Questions

1. Is each of the following a valid or invalid array definition? (If a definition is invalid, explain
why) Try to answer first before using Visual Studio - then check your answers using Visual
Studio to see if you understand why something worked or didnâ€™t

int[] numbers = new int[10] { 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1 }; is a valid array
int[] matrix = new int[5] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 };
	invalid. You cant define the array with more indexes than you initialized it with
double[] radii = new double[10] (3.2, 4.7};
	invalid. The array is initialized with 10 and only 2 values have been defined
int[] table = new int[7] { 2, , , 27, , 45, 39 };
	invalid. Values need to defined. Cannot have empty index
char[] codes = { 'A', 'X', '1', '2', 's' };
invalid. Needs to be initialized with a new char[] before the values are defined
int[] blanks;
	invalid. Needs to be initialized with new int[]
int[] collection = new int[-20];
	invalid. Cannot have negative array index
int[] hours = new int[3] 8, 12, 16;
	invalid. Need {} around the value definition

question 2 on next page
Given the following code what output would you expect?

int[] values = {2, 6, 10, 14};
Console.WriteLine(values[2]);  will output 10
Console.WriteLine(++values[0]); will output 3
Console.WriteLine(++values[0]); will output 4
int x = 2;
Console.WriteLine(values[++x]); will print out 14
Console.WriteLine(values[4]); will not print anything. Error: outside of array bounds
