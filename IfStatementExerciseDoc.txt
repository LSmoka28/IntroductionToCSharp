1. Try and describe an if statement:
	An if statement if a conditional statement where a block of code gets executed IF a certain condition is met as TRUE.

2. What happens if the condition of an if statement is true?
	The code block beneath gets executed.


3. Describe how else statements work:
	If the "if" statement returns the value of false, then the code block attche to "else" will execute.


4. Describe how else if statements work:
	Else if will execute a second/ seperate condition if the first if statement returns false.


5. In a series of if and else if statements, if the first if statement condition is true, and there
are 3 else if statements after it, how many of those else if statements will check their
conditions? Why?
	Only the first IF statement gets executed becasue the following statements only happen when the IF statement returns a boolean value of FALSE.



6. Can you give an example of a nested if statement?
	
	bool playerDead = false;
		
	if (playerHealth == 0)
		{
		playerDead = true;
			if {playerDead == true)
				{
				Console.WriteLine("You are deceased.");
				}

		}


7. What does the <= Less Then Or Equal relational operator do?
	The <= (less then or equal) operator compares the left-hand operand to see if the value if less than or equal to that of the right-hand operand.

8. What does the != Not Equal relational operator do?
	The != (not equal) operator swaps the boolean value of the operand
